/* Part 1: 
 * Goal: Find the largest element within the array using recursive methods.
 * Subarray has one element this element is the larget
 * Hint: Similar to how merge sort divides arrays.
 * Split the array in half, find the largest element from each division, and then compare the larger values. Return the largest element.
